# Energy Dashboard

A very *simple* dashboard for TAPO P110 and Omnik / Zeversolar solar inverters I use.

## Project setup
1. Requirements:
   - Python3
   - Docker
     
2. Installation:
    ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
## Local development
After setting up contener, Flask app should start by itself.

In order to rerun flask app use command:
 ```python3 app.py```
